A snippet of what I heard two people talking yesterday:  
"It doesn't sound right."  
"Yeah but it is grammatically correct."

The thing about grammar I think most people do not seem to get is (atleast I think that is the case, although it might not be at all and most people already figure this out at some point or the other) it is something fleshed out of a language's daily existence and usage in the real world. 

I went walking through the streets of Vile Parle last night with my girlfriend. There is a pav-bhaji place west of the station we were craving last evening for dinner. For reasons unimportant we got into a street we no requirement to get into and stumbled upon this fabulous dairy selling aamras by the kilo. It's summer and we hadn't had aamras the entire season. Hell, I hadn't even had a single mango. We bought ourselves two kilos of it. One for immediate consumption, one for friends. We did get a complimntary pack of ice-cream with it. The weird thing about this scenario is it was my idea to buy some for an office friend who ocassionally has got us gifts in the past. The reason it is weird is owing to my complete lack of any social skills when it comes to matters such as these.
