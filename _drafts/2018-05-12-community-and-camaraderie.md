Whenever I take the rare run at the beach back home I pass through a part of Tithal unvisited by the most tourist who come visit and is even ignored by the visitors from town. This part of the beach is not a secret or anything but it lies beyond a border surprisingly no one seems to want to come across. The beach is actually adjoined to the village roads and fishermen's houses, the governance not under the main town. Even the tourist development budgets for the beach do not leak across this virtual unhidden border for some reason. 

When you step onto the beach through the main town road and start walking walking north and keep walking going beyond the Swaminarayan temple on the coast you will find a diaphanous curtain of commercialism drop off and you will find yourself in the beach as it was twenty years ago frozen in time. The village boys and girls play cricket and football here with tennis-balls and basketballs respectively. The parents fish the waters and when they pull themselves along with their nets to the coast the kids run after them in the water hoping to catch a glimpse of the catch. It is mostly dead jellyfish and broken damp wood with the oocasional shrimp or shoe nowadays. 

I am severely out of breath, energy and bathed in sweat as I am running across this village beach and observing all of this silently. This time around I tried a different stratergy: interacting with the locals. I throw a ball across to those who have hit it too far out to retrieve quickly
