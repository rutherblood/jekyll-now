Whenever I take the rare run at the beach back home I pass through a part of Tithal unvisited by the most tourist who come visit and is even ignored by the visitors from town. This part of the beach is not a secret or anything but it lies beyond a border surprisingly no one seems to want to come across. The beach is actually adjoined to the village roads and fishermen's houses, the governance not under the main town. Even the development efforts of the beach do not cross this virtual unhidden border for some reason.
