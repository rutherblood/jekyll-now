Summers are the best time for watching sunsets. Not bluffing or trying to bore you here with simple things but maybe you _are_ underestimating the quality of a good sunlight. A beautiful one right in front of you gives you a strange strength and vitality. Try seeing a few of them before the monsoon begins. I'll suggest some spots.

Everyone's complaining about the daytime heat. I am usually seen complaining all day long. But take a break from whatever you are doing right now and witness a sunset whereever possible for you. We for example decided to go for Worli seaface. The sundays there are crowded but we did get a seat and sat there while the populated varied in time, listening to podcasts together, talking and watching the sunset unfold. So there are some qualities I greatly appericate which contributes towards making the perfect sunset:

1. The sheer length for various reasons. First, for the reason that we get to enjoy this sunset more. Second, because only longer sunsets seem to have the ability to throw the variety of colors which creates these various moods morphing in time. It is like a massive art exhibition on color theory.
