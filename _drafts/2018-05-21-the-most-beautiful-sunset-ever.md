Summers are the best time for watching sunsets. Not bluffing or trying to bore you here with simple things but maybe you _are_ underestimating the value a good sunset can generate in your life. A beautiful one right in front of you gives you a strange strength and vitality. Try seeing a few of them before the monsoon begins. I'll suggest some spots.

Everyone's complaining about the daytime heat. I am usually seen complaining all day long. But take a break from whatever you are doing right now and witness a sunset where-ever possible for you. We for example decided to go for Worli seaface. The sundays there are crowded but we did get a seat and sat there while the masses varied in time, listening to podcasts together, talking and watching the night unfold. So there are some qualities I greatly appericate which contributes towards making the perfect sunset:

1. The sheer length for various reasons. First, for the reason that we get to enjoy this sunset more. Second, because only longer sunsets seem to have the ability to throw the variety of colors which creates these various moods morphing in time. It is like a massive art exhibition on mind and the color theory.

2. The number of colors it morphs into and by. The colors are what ultimately give sunsets their charm. The more the better. Here are the one's to look out for: violet, pink, purple, blue, orange, crimson, red and various combinations thereof.

Last evening's sunset at Worli had all this. Gradual softening of colors into the eventual black of the night. Here we were sitting in the middle of one of these beauties, me not even noticing, listening together to [Casey and Candice's Couple's Therapy](https://anchor.fm/couples-therapy "Anchor link to Couple's Therapy podcast") (FTW BTW!) and my girlfriend suddenly goes, "Hey, this is one of those sunsets you have been talking about for so long!".

See you tomorrow,
