I now mostly ignore the self-help shelves at the bookstore after a brief stint with them as a school-boy. I used to have copies of them all, Robin Sharma, Rhonda Byrne, Tony Buzan and the many others I cannot recall. Most of these books present arguments which are unfalsifiable and frankly their preaching difficult to digest. But in some recent months I have came to possess some books which might seem like self-help but do not quite fit the streotypical mold this genre has generated: 

1. Cal Newport's _Deep Work_: Came across this book on Amazon and bought it from a bookstore in Juhu.
