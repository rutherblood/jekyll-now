Lately I have been fascinated by probability theory, statistics and anything in general which kind of pertains to economics, finance or real-life management of one's resources or as it pertains to gambling. Papers which do not fundamentals but provide a different way of seeing the world around us. More importantly these papers need to give us wisdom instead of just preaching math and building theoretical frameworks. 

Now, I wish I had the intelligence and exposure or the time to read one paper everyday but unfortuantely that not being the case the many papers I have come to become fascinated with I hardly complete and most get shelved. I have taken a liking for [this](https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/simplified.pdf "The Complexity of Computing Nash Equilibrium") one right now after reading this [blog-post](https://ristret.com/s/qk8wpt/philosophy_computational_complexity "The Philosophy Of Computation Complexity at Ristret") trending at HN for example. There is [yet another resource](http://fermatslibrary.com/ "Fermat's Library") which is fascinating for its core idea: of curating fantastic papers from diverse areas of human study and letting the community annotate over them. In other things I have also been lately really occupied with particular articles at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I have a [friendship](https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/ "Friends of the SEP") which means I can get nice PDF versions of these articles. Here are some which have been occupying me lately:

1. [Computation Complexity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-complexity/ "Computation Complexity SEP entry") & [Computability and Complexity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computability/ "Computability and Complexity SEP entry"): After reading the aforementioned blog-post.

2. [Philosophy of Statistics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/ "Philosophy of Statistics SEP entry") & [Bayes' Theorem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayes-theorem/ "Bayes' Theorem SEP entry"): For aforementioned reasons.

3. [Plotinus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plotinus/ "Plotinus SEP entry"): Yours humbly from being an atheist is now slowly blooming to an agnost. Another post begging to to be writ. Details will come :)

4. [Aristotle's Logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-logic/ "Aristotle's Logic SEP entry") & [The Traditional Square of Opposition](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/square/ "The Traditional Square of Opposition SEP entry"): This has been after a general reasoning class where we were learning syllogisms and I was particularly troubled by some aspects of the "some" quantifier. The past few days I missed writing posts during has largely been due to a contribution of not knowing what to write about and being excited about writing something on syllogisms. But I did not want to do this without prep, failed to prep and failed to write any posts as well. That was brutal but I do mean to complete it and have it up here in the near future. Hold tight.

5. [The Problem of Induction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/induction-problem/ "The Problem of Induction SEP entry"): I have yet to read this but there are many places which lead me to this one. My own work with palm rejection, the above mentioned article on philosophy of statistics and the class on syllogism fueled my fascination with this idea of induction and Hume's ideas in general.

See you tomorrow,  
Avi.
