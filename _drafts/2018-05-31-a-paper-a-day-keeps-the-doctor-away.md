Lately I have been fascinated by probability theory, statistics and anything in general which kind of pertains to economics, finance or real-life management of one's resources or as it pertains to gambling. Papers which do not fundamentals but give a different way of seeing the world around us. More importantly these papers need to give me wisdom instead of just preaching math and building theoretical frameworks. 

Now, I wish I had the intelligence and exposure or the time to read one paper everyday but unfortuantely that not being the case the many papers I have come to become fascinated with I hardly complete and get shelved.
