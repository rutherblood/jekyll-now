During my internship here in Bombay some friends and I and lived to used at a flat on NM Joshi Marg near Elphinstone Station. The flat was just near a corner of Bombay where many sweet memories were made. Deepak Talkies, now Carnival Cinemas but also known as Matterden in both its avatars was where I first saw Frida at their off-beat Sundaty afternoon slot. Matterden was also where my girlfriend and I watched our first film together which was The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night. After watching the film we visited Cafe Free India just opposite Matterden for the first time. The food there is always fantastic by the way. Highly recommended. Pick up anything from the menu.

That small slice of Bombay is where beauty and a strange subtlety always lies. Take Matterden. It is a theatre home to an ideology. Each Sunday it screens an art film at very cheap rates. Most shows for these movies are with just a few people in there.
