During my internship here in Bombay some friends and I and lived to used at a flat on NM Joshi Marg near Elphinstone Station. The flat was just near a corner of Bombay where many sweet memories were made. Deepak Talkies, now Carnival Cinemas but also known as Matterden in both its avatars was where I first saw Frida at their off-beat Sundaty afternoon slot. Matterden was also where my girlfriend and I watched our first film together which was The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night. After the film we first visited Cafe Free India for the first time. The food there is always fantastic by the way. Highly recommended. Pick up anything from the menu.
