[ The Dictionary Of Obscure Sorrows_](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/ "Hyperlink to The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows site") by John Koenig is the kind of project that makes me boil in jealousy. This is not just owing to its great success but also the sheer simplicity of its core idea and a wish that this could have occurred to me first and had this become _my_ lifelong obsession and work.

I was sitting in the grammar class, the one I have mentioned earlier, pondering on the little atoms of speech that makes up a sentence.

Though I never use to elucidate what it was and any attempts by me to explain it here my only result in crypticism that has been my agenda to avoid. I will take these risks nevertheless, breaking rules as important as making them.

There was a gap in me that I believed made me failure in communicating effectively or connect with any human being. I had friends but all except one knew nothing about me, and I knew nothing about them. I used a fancy term for this asociality, this missing thing but the reason it was important for me to frame was because I thought
