There is a place in my hometown I had been searching for a few years back. A place settled among the trees and the sun and beautiful in all capacity. The mountains fascinated me for a value of hiddeness that theey brought. I did find that place when I started wandering the forests around a local hill on the top of which was situated a small fort and a temple. I was looking for privacy ofcourse but I was also looking for a spot to call my own, somewhere once I connect to person, could bring them here and show a peice of me. 

One of such other places is the Waghai botanical garden one encounters on the road to Saputara. I have visited this place many times over the years. This has always been during family trips
