There is a certain feeling about certain ways of behaving in an office you come to realize makes some people seem dominant and important. This feeling is not certain in the early days but you come to recognize assholes who boast out a lot whenever they are even temporarily right and suck the entire limelight or credit for 1% insight they gave, the 99% work that you did now down the garbage of unimportance.

Now this is fine when these assholes are right but imagine this. Another asshole, a sychophant of the first and dumbfuck loudmouth in general comes by and starts poking his nose into your matters and giving you opinion how things should go on or when you explain your work
