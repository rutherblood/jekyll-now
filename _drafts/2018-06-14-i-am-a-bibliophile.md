Lately I have come to be afraid of accquiring new books. This is majorly because I have been reading a lot less than my liking, frankly because I have not had the time to do so for atleast a year now. Maybe I need to acquire a habit of gobbling books even with a hectic schedule, a constant never seeming to go away for now and possibly never in the future. That I shall do. But meanwhile, I have been reading a lot less and acquiring books on a much faster pace than managing to finish them.

This has to majorly change because it makes me quite guilty of two things: not reading enough and precisely because of _that_, being vain enough to collect many books and let them collect dust. The acquiring habit is not going away as far as I can see because the books I have on my shelf feel like an extension of me and frankly because that is a habit I do not wish to suppress. Meanwhile, I only envy the tremendous reading productivity of YouTuber's like The Book Chemist and Better Than Food, both my favorite book review channels on YouTube. An update on what  I acquired most recently: Nassim Taleb's _Skin in the Game_. Also my girlfriend gifted me this printed copy of Kant's _Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics_ because that one was simply too expensive on Amazon or elsewhere. An update on what I am reading these days: Cal Newport's _Deep Work_.

See you tomorrow,  
Avi.
