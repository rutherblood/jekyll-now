Lately I have come to be afraid of accquiring new books. This is majorly because I have been reading a lot less than my liking frankly because I have not had the time to do so for atleast a year now. Maybe I need to acquire a habit of gobbling books even with a hectic schedule, a constant never seeming to go away for now and possibly never in the future. That I shall do. But meanwhile, I have been reading a lot less and acquiring books on a much faster pace than managing to finish them.

This has to majorly change because it makes me quite guilty of two things: not reading enough and precisely because of that being vain enough to collect many books and let them collect dust.
