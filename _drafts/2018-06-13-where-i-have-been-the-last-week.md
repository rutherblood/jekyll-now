A generic quote someone I know on Whatsapp attributes to Harvey MacKay: _A dream is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline_.

I started this blog with the intention of reaching two different goals. Both of these goals are very similar in nature. They require me to put in enormous amounts of discipline and require that I work [deeply](http://www.contemplify.com/2017/10/24/041-cal-newport-on-kindling-an-examined-life-through-deep-work-author-of-deep-work/ "Contemplify episode with Cal Newport"). And since I cannot allocate huge monolithic chunks of my life to them as of now, it becomes important that I build a discipline of daily effort towards them where I allocate a set amount of hours. The poorly understood compounding should do the rest of my work afterward if am honest with myself.
