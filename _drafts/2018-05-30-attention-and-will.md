I have missed four days in total. My schedule had really been erratic and to be honest I conciously ignored blogging as an active priority. This was me ignoring the things I really should not be. Over the past year, the only thing I can say definitely I have learned is not to ignore the things that are yours. Deep, managed attention to all the things that belong to you, your sense of self, your possessions including your books, desk, clothes, your favorite wooden spoon you love eating in the bowl with, the people you truly love and want always to be there in your life, all these things brings about a sense of satisfaction and self-regulation among them that you so desire to live a harmonius life. This blog has now become a vital part of it.
