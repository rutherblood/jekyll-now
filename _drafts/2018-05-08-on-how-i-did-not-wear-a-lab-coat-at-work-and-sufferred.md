One of my current roommates works at a government centre for disease control research here at Currey Road. He is a biotechnology graduate and his work most requires him to collect data in experiments according to a strictly defined protocol. The word "protocol" here is key. 

The experiments have to be performed according to a pre-established principle. Protocols become important in a setting where there is a high chance of a minor mistake invalidating the entire set of results which draw on the data generated by these experiments. These biotech protocols usually require years to master as they need one to work with and control unstable chemicals, living tissue, dirty vessels, one's own body, the environment itself. Dirt from under your dirty fingernails can invalidate six months of your work in a second. My roomate over the course of the year has worked on just two of these.

Lately, I have come to take an interest in such matters because of a development in my own work. My current project requires me to work with the Touch API in browsers: filtering unrequired palm touches when one writes with a stylus on an HTML5 canvas on touch devices in the natural manner one writes with on a sheet of paper. My goto device on which I have been testing and for which I am polishing my results is an iPad 10.

A solution to the problem lies with machine learning. Inspired by this paper I set out to train a decision tree in the matters of palm and stylus. How one trains a decision tree is by generating a relational (tabular) dataset with various characterstics of a touch contact (when I say _touch contact_, what I mean is a single touch gesture right from the start upon first contact, to the movements and to the end when you pick up your finger, stylus, palm or whatever you've set to rest on that screen) like the distance of the start contact from it's neighbors start's within a given timewindow, mean radius and the like. Now, each entry in this dataset is labelled as _palm_ or _stylus_ and handed over to a decision-tree generation algorithm like the C4.5 or CART to juggle with. I take this decision tree, encode it to if-else clauses and use it in my final product. How I collect the data is by taking an HTML5 canvas, generating a random 10px circle anywhere on it and asking a labrat to try initiating a stroke from inside the circle using a stylus while naturally resting her palm on the iPad like she would on a sheet of paper. Simple right?

Except it's not if **YOU'RE AN UNDISCIPLINED AND INCONSISTENT FUCK**. You see I am that way and this is a protocol. I have the feeling and I think it is mostly right that when it comes to modern statistical machine learning it is not quite different from
