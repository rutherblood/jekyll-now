One of my current roomates works at a government centre for disease control research here at Currey Road. He is a biotechnology graduate and his work most requires him to collect data in expriments according to a strictly defined protocol. The word "protocol" here is key. 

The experiments have to be performed according to a pre-established principle. Experimental protocols become important in a setting where there is a high chance of a minor mistake invalidating the entire results which draw on the data generated by these experiments.
