The day before yesterday I was walking the bridge from Bandra terminus to Bandra station where the local trains ride at. As much the name Bandra in one evokes a feeling of Juhu, sunny streets, film industry, celebrities and hip cafes and gourmet restaurants, the east of Bandra should evoke in one a sense of dread. This is what a post-apocalyptic organized society might look like.

The bridge had no footpath to walk on. I was stuck walking at the sides, other people were doing it already.
