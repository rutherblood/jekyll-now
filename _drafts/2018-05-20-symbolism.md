I am back after my first biweekly break yesterday. I have decided to take a day off from this daily blog after every two weeks. This is largely to get a perspective on where things are going and how I performed in those last two weeks. I have something to confess though: yesterday'ss break was not something preplanned. Coincidentally, it was just the day after this blog's two-week anniversary and I happened to miss my schedule due to early morning obligtions and then getting stuck up the rest of the day.

There is a certain problem I am facing.
