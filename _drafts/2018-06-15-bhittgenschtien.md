I have been fascinated with Wittenstien's _Tractus_ for long now. This was mainly owing to envy on my part about not knowing of these greats well enough to understand what the hype was all about. For example, I have always taken a liking for the works of David Foster Wallace and being an student of analytical philosophy as we once was he did get alot into Wittgenstien. I have also had a copy of Logicomix for long now that I have not managed to yet finish but rathers sits on my shelf. 

Russell is always an old man replaced by the young in my mind. However great a public intellectual and philosopher in his own right as he may be, he always seems to be path towards Wittgenstien or Godel in my mind. Now, I could be very wrong.
