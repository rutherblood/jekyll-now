I am on a mountaintop now. Each mountain has a personality which comes out through a variety of physical factors such as the state of mind you are in right now, the people you are with or whether you are alone, the sheer weather of the place. If someone were to put a gun to my head and ask me what personality this one has, I would say it is a monomaniacal soul-enervating one.

Mostly because I am finding the dry hot daylight weather here to be deadning. One cannot sit in the car even with the air-conditioner at full bloom and the place lacks any particular thing to do when with family. I mean you could get a paraglider for 2000/- and ride the sky but even that does not seem to be worth it for the money. The sunset is beautiful from up here though. The beauty of the sunlight is much defined by the sheer spectrum of colors with which it paints the horizon. Crimson, orange, pink, indigo, blue and purple.

I went swimming yesterday in the hotel pool. Luckily I was the only person there. I do not know how to swim but luckily the pool water did not reach over my nose.
