When I was a boy back in my pre-teens going to school in my hometown two of my friends had a [Gameboy Advance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iZJgkU4gSw "YouTube link to unboxing the Gameboy Advance"). This was before the iPhone back in 2007. I was fascinated by these devices to death but would never borrow them to have a go at a game. I wanted to possess one of these baddies so bad even seeing another not mine would coil a part of me in smothering jealousy. Unfortuantely you never got these devices easily in India. Atleast in the places I had practical access to or knew about. And even if I did I was pretty sure these would be expensive as hell. So I was pretty much destined to not have them at all. 

Enter emulation. This is an entire internet culture around emulating these old retro-computing devices and bringing their ghosts back on mordern machines. [This guy](http://blog.rekawek.eu/2017/02/09/coffee-gb/ "Blog post for CoffeeGB") spent over a month building a Gameboy/Color emulator in Java for example. The thing that fascinates me about emulation is the process of learning everything about every aspect of these devices: CPU, graphics, timing, memory, I/O, how the cartridges work and the like. My Gameboy love long dead now resurrected as a digital ghost. But the emulation is never satisfying. You see, these devices still fascinate me as they do hundreds of thousands of others precisely because of their physical form. Touch devices like phones, as amazing as they are cannot replace the feeling of hitting a hard button while gaming. 

In other things there is an another kind of emulation I have had my mind on. It is to translate Samuel Beckett's [Waiting For Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wifcyo64n-w "YouTube link to a semi-cinematic version of Waiting For Godot") to Gujarati. While searching for the link to a performance on YouTube I did come across many videos with India lecturers in them giving a well-rehearsed explanation of the play with comments usually explaining how the lecturer pronounced _Godot_ or _Estragon_ incorrectly and other basic facts as to when the play was first conducted or who first coined the term _Theatre of the Absurd_. I had no idea this was a play common in Indian B.A. syllabuses. I am sure there is a Hindi translation floating around somewhere.
