When I was a boy back in my pre-teens going to school in my hometown two of my friends had a [Gameboy Advance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iZJgkU4gSw "YouTube link to unboxing the Gameboy Advance"). This was before the iPhone back in 2007. I was fascinated by these devices to death but would never borrow them to have a go at a game. I wanted to possess one of these baddies so bad even seeing another not mine would coil a part of me in smothering jealousy.

Unfortuantely you never got these devices easily in India. Atleast in the places I had access to or knew about.
