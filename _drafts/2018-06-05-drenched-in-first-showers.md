I was at work when the first showers broke with heavy winds, last evening in Bombay. One of the office glass windows broke open from its fixture and the entire planet seemed to be shaking violently. It was hilarious. 

Here I was stuck at office, unable to go home. So after waiting for twenty minutes in the building lobby I took my phone charger, other peripherals, my wallet and secured them in the back of my backpack and just slid my phone in my jeans' backpocket and decided to make a run for home. Needless to say I was compeltely drenched. My back was safe, my phone was completely dry. Afterwards, when I took a shower at home the water would feel cold on my back but almost warm on my chest and stomach at the same time. Getting entirely sogged would have almost been romantic and like in the movies, had it not been rushing home from work and had I not been alone. 

See you tomorrow,  
Avi.
