I'm home. Home is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/uMBUZP5htXp "Google Maps link to Valsad"). The sunlight here is amazing. The day is hot but the sea saves us nevertheless. 

Coming by from the train station last night, the rickshaw-wallah points out to me how hot it is in cities up north like Ahmedabad or Baroda as compared to here. He says it's mostly the greens that still are in full bloom here compared to the disappearing fortunes of cities up north. We then got into discussing India and China, India's population problems and the loss of humanity that it causes.

Bombay that way can be described as a hat trick. It makes you forget there is a place free of its buildings, layers, sewers, trains and hot roads out there. Time flows differently as a result and everyday seems like a NetFlix show. 

I woke up late today. Whenever I do come home I wish of a morning run at Tithal but that unfortuntely never happens. The flow of time is definitely different out here. One thinks of more time the day has to offer than is possible there at Bombay. Although it could just be the holiday from work working my mind. Anyway, stay sassy and productive. Love.

See you tomorrow,  
Avi.
