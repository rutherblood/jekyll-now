I had been meaning to do an important post today but I screwed up with the schedule, time is now running short for me and I cannot. It must wait. Meanwhile I would just like to leave you with some Pink Floyd.

The time I discovered Floyd was during my third college year at Baroda. At that time we were living in an apartment in Fatehgunj whose balcony faced west and the sunlight washed in through the open door and windows into the hall. The walls of this apartment were colored yellow and the sunlight made it glow. The afternoons were the best. Plenty sunlight and the room awashed with this golden glow. I used to sit for hours on end listening to Pink Floyd during this time, often reading a book. Very good memories of that time, simple as it was in its inactivity. I remember I used to listen to [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yusGUGTVAyw "YouTube link to Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother suite") alot in particular usually making sure it conincided with the sunset and dusky hues. 

See you tomorrow,
Avi.
