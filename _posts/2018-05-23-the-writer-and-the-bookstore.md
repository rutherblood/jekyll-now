Yesterday evening during work I ditched a half hour and made a visit to the [Trilogy](http://www.teltrilogy.com/ "Trilogy and The Eternal Library website") bookstore here at Lower Parel. I had just discovered their Instagram account earlier and saw [Jerry Pinto](https://scroll.in/article/838552/i-have-written-standing-up-in-buses-on-the-fourth-seat-of-a-mumbai-local-jerry-pinto "Scroll interview of Jerry Pinto") was there not long ago for a workshop. The person/(proprietor?) who billed my books confirmed this. 

"Any chance he might come again anytime soon?"  
"Nothing's planned as of now"

There are reasons this incident is so tragic to my life:

1. Jerry Pinto's [Em and The Big Hoom](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/03/em-and-the-big-hoom-jerry-pinto-family-life-bombay "Guardian article covering Jerry Pinto's Em and The Big Hoom") connected so deeply to me because his family felt so much like my own. I could not help but compare his mom's struggles to my mom's. While my mom is not bipolar she's suffered from chronic migraines for a long time now.

2. Living in less connected places like my hometown or Baroda I'd always wished for places that might host people like me, writers and artists. Now that I do have a place, a place which hosts these writers flesh and bone, writers which I have come to deeply value all that stops me is my own schedule and the bliss of not knowing at the right time that these things are happening. I also missed a free [Peter Cat Recording Co.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9jEQB53EAk "YouTube link to PCRC's I'm Home") concert not even a kilometer away from where I live last Friday!

Anyway.

See you tomorrow,  
Avi.
