There is a certain feeling you start to have about certain ways of behaving in an office you come to realize makes some people seem dominant and important. This feeling is not certain in the early days and you think these people important and geniuses but you come to recognize assholes who boast out a lot whenever they are even temporarily right and suck the entire limelight or credit for 0.01% insight they gave, the 99.99% work that someone else did down the garbage of unimportance.

Now, this is fine when these assholes are right but imagine this. Another asshole, a sychophant of the first and dumbfuck loudmouth in general comes by and starts poking his nose into your matters and giving you his opinion how things should go on or when you explain your work to him out of being polite to the questions he's asked, dismisses it as something irrelavant and that all this is very much known to him. This dumbfuck now goes on to go all asslicky over the former asshole about his 0.01% contribution and how that is all that mattered in the project, **THAT WAS THE GENIUS, THE MAIN INSIGHT, THE NUCLEAR BOMB COMPARED TO YOUR EARLIER BOW AND ARROW**. Shove a uranium rod up his ass in your mind now.

Turns out the results which made these 1% contributions right were invalid. Hahahahahaha, fuck them. The latter asshole thinks himself a well-read know-it-all in **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE** even though he has _zero_ practice in the field to show for. This is called being salted and greasy by the latest cool-sounding trend. Do not ever get salted and greasy by the latest, trendiest hype-word. The problem is he speaks a lot and interjects whenever I am discussing my work with the former asshole. Oh, how I would love to announce today the 0.01% contribution results were invalid. Hahahahahahahahahahaha!

See you tomorrow,  
Avi.
